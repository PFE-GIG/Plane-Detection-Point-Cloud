Persistence Analysis of Multi-scale Planar Structure Graph in Point Clouds

## TODO
- Important
    - Region growing + filter (CGAL?)
    - Graph 
    - Persistence analysis
    - scripts to run the pipeline
    - test data
- Other
    - program to compute normals
    - replace 'simple' proj by 'quasi-orthogonal' proj
    - use cuda for computing multi-scale features
    - polygonal reconstruction
